                    on this tools to make clients happy and make sure that all the webs that they made are 100% done. one of the LANGUAGES team for web-dev is "Front-End"
                    front end is what you, me and all of the users see on the Website. What about Team members? team main memebers are HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT with their
                    own frameworks.

                    or even more likily advanced sections. Time by time HTML is becoming more understandable and eazier to use. We getting no inside tool Like

                        <p>What's CSS and how can it be used or even is This language. Yes this questions for like extra starters are common couse like HTML, CSS is on of the strange language 
                            what's strange in it let's me xplain. Imagine humans body what's the starting part for human, Yes it's true "bones" imagine HTML is the god tool to make bones for human in our
                            anspect WebPage. Alright, but what about CSS? Good question CSS is the next part for god Tool. Humnas body can't only have bones. Its need some skin to cover it, yes to make
                            human good and not scary or something.It's same on WebPage Without CSS belive me that Website looks disgusting, CSS's main mission to make website look good and webdevs are 
                            makeing some really exiting things with it.
                        </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="JAVASCRIPT">
            <header class="main-header color-4">JAVASCRIPT</header>
            <article>
                <div class="container">
                    <p>Now, What about JAVASCRIPT. Let's me told you that it's the most important one. JAVASCRIPT not only can used on webs, it's also can used on games robots and so much cool things.
                    Do you remember what i was saying about god tools and human body. Exactly next step is JAVASCRIPT. If we have human body with bones, organs and skin one thing that is left for huamn 
                    is to be useful. Yes without any working he might die from starving and even without working we wouldn't be who we are now. YES, JAVASCRIPT helps CSS and HTML to make human body work 
                    it's can teach you how to walk run work play and so much thing. It's like parrent for eveyhone. On our side without JAVASCRIPT we can't make website work. We can't make any events or
                    even we can't make any transition or like everyhing expect look is about JAVASCRIPT. Do you remember this frameworks that i just told about. 3 of them are JAVASCRIPT's frameworks. why?
                    Couse it's pretty hard language and you human being need to understand it's eazyer.

                <div class="container">
                    <P>Yes, It's looks similler to Front-End. I think that you might guessed that it's another group of language and if you do, you are right. It's the group of language, but little bit of different
                    this group have lot's of members, but two of them is most knonw and most useful they are:
                    </P>
                    <div class="frameworks">
                        <li>PHP</li>
                        <li>MYSQL</li>
                    </div>
                    <P>What's different in it. Expect Front-End, here you can't see what developer is doing. It's a tool to make things on backgorund getting information about user, but without any
                    law braking, adjusting coockies, working on your security, databases, collecting info for your own security and fast loading abd all of this without any appereance

                <div class="container">
                    <p>Okey, new one PHP. Again what's that and how can be used. PHP is xxactly what we talked about getting info adjusting coockies, collecting things pretty much doing most of 
                    work, It's really soft thing touching it's without knowledge might couse kind of porblems on web. Pretty much it's gateway to database, which is of course on of the important 
                    thing. As well here in internet and social medias here is so much classes about it's and how it works, It's like working in HTML, but little bit different you need to make them
                    work together without any bugs and lt's me tell you fixing bugs is one of the most thign you will do with this language.

                <div class="container">
                    <p>And last one, MYSQL. For makeing things clear it's one of the big team members without it here is so much other "DataBases" like this one. Only thing i choose it is that it's 
                    most knowned and used one. Did you heared what i said "DataBase" Yes, its databaes. Here is stored bunch of information about website makeing damage on this can make whole work 
                    vanished and this one is usualy target for hackers so it's need one good cybersecurity team. Any information from the language's that i mansioned are stored here so keep eye on it.
